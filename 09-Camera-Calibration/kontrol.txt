How many points are minimally required for calibration? Why?
At least 6 points are needed to provide enough equations 
to solve for the 11 unknown parameters of the 3Ã—4
P (since one parameter is fixed due to scale ambiguity).

Why do more points improve calibration quality?
More points reduce the effect of noise and errors in the measurements,
leading to a more robust estimation of the projection matrix.
