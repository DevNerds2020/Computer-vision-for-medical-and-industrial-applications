a) Why is the χ² test used for comparing histograms?
It quantifies similarity by calculating normalized squared differences between bins.
Value 0: Identical histograms.
Value 1: Maximum difference.

b) What does the confusion matrix describe?
It shows classification performance: true labels vs. predicted labels.
Easier digits: Clear, distinct shapes (e.g., "1").
Harder digits: Similar features (e.g., "8" and "3").

c) Describe the distance measure D(P,Q)D(P, Q).
It sums differences across bins: D(P,Q)=∑(P−Q)2P+QD(P, Q) = \sum \frac{(P - Q)^2}{P + Q}.

d) Is the shape descriptor invariant to translation, rotation, and scaling?
Translation: Yes, by centering points.
Rotation/Scaling: No, but normalization (e.g., aligning principal axes, scaling radii) ensures invariance.
